.SH "PURPOSE"

.B generand
is a simple program to rapidly generate random genomics data
streams in common formats such as FASTA, FASTQ, SAM, and VCF.

This may be useful for generating very short examples for academic purposes
or large streams for testing and benchmarking genomics programs.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.B generand fast[aq] sequences sequence-length
generates a FASTA or FASTQ stream of 
"sequences" sequences, each of length "sequence-length".  The sequence
content is random with a uniform distribution of bases, so that GC content
should be very close to 50%.

PHRED scores in FASTQ streams are generated in blocks of equal scores and
are mostly high-quality.  The last few scores are lower quality and
independent to simulate Illumina sequencing, where quality tends to drop
near the end of each read.

.B generand sam chromosomes alignments-per-chromosome sequence-length
generates a SAM stream with chromosomes * alignments-per-chromosome total
alignments.  It outputs increasing indexes for QNAME and CHROM, randomly
increasing POS, random QUAL scores, and random sequences and PHRED scores
as stated for FASTQ above.

.B generand vcf chromosomes calls-per-chromosome samples
generates a VCF stream with chromosomes * calls-per-chromosome calls.
It outputs chromosomes with increasing indexes, randomly increasing POS,
uniformly random REF and ALT, uniformly random QUAL scores, and random
sample columns including GT (genotype), AD (allelic depth) and DP (depth).
REF counts are always >= ALT counts in the AD data and DP = REF count + ALT
count.
