# generand

Generate random genomic data in FASTA/FASTQ, SAM, or VCF format, output
to the standard output.

Output data is completely random and suitable for basic testing and
benchmarking of new programs, or for quickly generating small samples for
academic purposes.

Generand is especially useful for generating large test inputs on-the-fly
so that they need not be manually generated and/or stored.

Currently the randomization is very simplistic, but we will likely add
paramaters in the future to allow generating more realistic data for specific
situations.
